    note:
      - Mobaco was produced by the Dutch company N.V. Plaatmetaalindustrie van Mouwerik & Bal from 1924 to 1961
        in Zeist, The Netherlands. Known commonly as Moubal, the company specialized in sheet metal products
        and occasionally crafted Mobaco parts during machine cleanings. In 1949, the toy and puzzle company
        Jumbo took over the sales and marketing of Mobaco, enhancing the sets and manuals to appeal to a broader
        market while production continued at Moubal.
      - The Mobaco system uses wooden posts that fit into a fiberboard base and cardboard panels that slide into the
        slots on the posts. The panels come in different colors and can have various window or door cut-outs.

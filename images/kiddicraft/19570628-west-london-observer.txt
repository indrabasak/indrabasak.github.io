WROTE DIRECTOR, THEN KILLED HIMSELF 

Harry Fisher Page, 52- year-old toy manufacturer. of Barkston Gardens, South Kensington, who was found gassed in his Ellis Street, Chelsea, office on Tuesday, worried about the success of one of his products. 

At the Hammersmith inquest on Wednesday, co-director. Mr. Charles Warwick Allpass, of Headley. Epsom, said. "He had been working very hard for the past nine months on production which had been rather too successful. 

"Supplies were not meeting demand, but the extent of his worries was certainly unjustified."

 Mr. Page's secretary. Mrs. Patricia Sylces-Wright, of Harrington Road. South Kensington, said that Monday evening her employer asked her to take down an important letter to the Board and then told her to go home. 

 When Mrs. Oreline Page went the office the following morning she found her husband dead. A gas tap was turned on. On the of the office was pinned a notice: "Bewareâ€”Gas." 

 The Coroner. Mr. G. Thurston, recording verdict of suicide, said that the letter gave a clear impression that Mr. Page intended to end his own life.

In any Bengali middle class household in the 60s and 70s (and probably earlier), 
a quarter pound _pauruti_ was ubiquitous as a cup of tea. Who can forget the 
chini (sugar) toast or deem pauruti (French toast) or even dunking a plain piece 
of pauruti in a cup of tea. Yum! 

Pauruti was a rectangular loaf of bread with a slightly bulbous head. It came in 
different sizes based on weight - quarter pound, half pound, etc. I, like most
other folks, was under the wrong impression that the Bengali word of feet (pa)
was the etymology of pauruti. It’s not quite true. Later, I came to know that it
either came from the Portuguese _pau_ meaning bread or the Hindi _pao_ meaning
quarter. The word origin is still not settled.

Though I’m not sure if quarter pound paurutis are still being sold in the
streets of Calcutta wrapped inside small paper bags, it will forever remain
etched in my tastebud.

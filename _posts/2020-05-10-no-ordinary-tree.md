The first time I laid my eyes on that pamphlet, turned slightly yellow from its age, 
I was intrigued by the image of a leafless apple tree. It was no ordinary tree, 
but the first apple tree ever grown on the Pacific Coast and it was right here 
in Oregon City; not far from where I stood. The tree stood on the yard 
of the first ever protestant church built in North America, west of the Rockies. 
That’s a couple of firsts.

Around 1892, the tree made its first appearance in Pacific Christian Advocate, 
a Methodist newspaper. I have seen a photocopy of this issue, but  not able to 
locate a copy in its entirety. It’s only available in 
microfiche. The tree again showed up in Hines’ (1896) book on Jason Lee, 
with the original photo and description from the Advocate. There’s even a 
passing reference of the tree with an illustration in Fletcher’s (1902) book 
on the history of Methodism.

This tree started its life in late 1840 as a sapling from seeds thrown away by 
Rev. Alvin (Alvan) F. Waller’s wife. The seeds from dried apples were 
brought from New York during Waller family’s long trip to Oregon Territory 
(Hines, 1896). It’s unusual to grow apple trees from seeds as they are 
genetically unpredictable but in this case it turned out to be a great fruit 
bearing tree. Rev. Waller, a Methodist minister, left a mark in early Oregon 
history due to his dispute with Dr. John McLoughlin over land claims at the 
Willamette Falls, the present day Oregon City. His main legacy, however, 
was the establishment of Willamette Falls Methodist Mission and the 
Willamette University.  The Waller Hall at the Willamette University is 
named after him.

In December 1842, Rev. Waller was the main force behind the subscription 
drive to fund the construction of the first protestant church, west of the 
Rockies (Lockley, 1928).  In between his busy schedule, he found time to nurse 
an apple sapling. Rev. Waller’s time in Oregon City came to an abrupt end in 1843, and he was 
reassigned to the Willamette Mission near Salem. This sudden change probably 
had to do with the Methodist church’s interest in de-escalating the “situation” 
with Dr. McLoughlin and the Hudson Bay Company.  

Before Rev. Waller left for Willamette Mission, he handed the sapling to Rev. 
Gustavus Hines, a fellow missionary at “The Falls” (Hines, 1896). Rev. Hines 
planted the young tree near the parsonage, where he was residing. The building 
of the Methodist Episcopal (M. E.) Church which started during Rev. Waller’s 
time was completed in 1843 at the corner of Third and Main Street. The dedicatory 
sermon was given by Rev. Hines (Lockley, 1928). 

Getting back to the apple tree, it didn’t appear in any of the church drawings 
or photograph(s) at its first location. This is where it gets interesting. The Oregon City 
Enterprise (Nov 18, 1904) mentioned the tree was planted - “in front and near 
the corner of the parsonage, that was situated just south of the present day 
Methodist church, on Main street in Oregon City.” The newspaper was referring 
to the second location of the church at the corner of Seventh and Main Street. 
However, the church and the parsonage wasn’t moved from its original location 
at Third and Main Street until the winter of 1855. I believe the tree was 
initially planted in the Third Street location and later replanted in Seventh Street.

by a cross, just above the Swampy Lake (Rich, 1944)

An illustration of the M. E. Church first shows up in the painting of Henry J. 
Warre, a British army officer. Warre visited Oregon City around January 1845. 
He even had the good fortune of dining at the house of Dr. McLoughlin’s son. 
(Major-Frégeau, 1976). During his visit, he drew a detailed hand-drawn map of 
Oregon City where he showed the location of the church (Rich, 1944).

Though lithographs (Warre, 1848) of Warre’s paintings are common, I am including 
both his painting and lithograph to illustrate the difference between the 
artist's original intention and a lithographer's interpretation. The M. E. 
Church is in the middle of the picture. The St. John the Apostle Church appears 
on the extreme left.

The church was again captured in John Mix Stanley’s painting from 1850. 
Stanley’s painting portrays the church from the bluff on the Oregon City side.

A detailed sketch of the church appeared in a couple of Gaston’s books on Oregon 
(Gaston, 1911 and 1912). It’s the clearest illustration of the M. E. Church 
at its first location that I’ve come across.

A model of the old church building is displayed at the Oregon City Methodist 
United Church, the present day  M. E. Church. Notice the wood shingles
and the green shutters. The old church building would make a very nice Lego model.
Maybe I'll try it one day.

The M. E. Church on Third Street holds a special place in Oregon history. 
Oregon’s provisional legislature met here in 1847. The first meeting of the 
Oregon’s Territorial Legislature took place here on July 16, 1849. This was 
the meeting where the legislative body decided to change “the names of Champoeg, 
Tualatin, and Vancouver counties respectively to Marion Washington and Clark” 
(Gaston, 1912). George Abernethy, the first Governor Oregon under the provisional 
government, even donated the church bell.

Third Annual Oregon Methodist Conference at the Third Street location, Oregon City, 1855 

In 1855, the third annual Oregon Methodist conference was held in Oregon City. 
It attracted all types of missionaries and church clergy men from the Oregon 
territory. The only known photograph of the M. E. Church at the Third Street 
location was taken during this occasion. If you look at the picture carefully, 
the church building doesn't look that small anymore.

In 1855, the church was moved to its second location at the corner of Seventh 
and Main Street. According to Lynch (1973), “it seemed profitable to move to 
the corner of Seventh and Main Street on the block which the church won in 
settlement with Dr. McLoughlin, and to sell the other location. E. W. Swafford 
took his ox-team and moved the church and parsonage down the street”. 
Elias W. Swafford was an early pioneer at Oregon City and at one time held 
the office of Steward in the M. E. Church (Hines, 1893).

the apple tree behind the church building.

The apple tree made an appearance in most of the church pictures at the second 
location. A few different black and white pictures of the church, at its 
second location, is floating around the internet. The most frequently 
cited picture comes from the collection of Oregon State University. The only 
colorized photo of the M. E.Church that I have across was in a slide series 
titled “The Indian Trail” put out by M. E. Church.

By 1890, the church became too small for its growing congregation and was 
replaced by “a handsome modern structure with gothic windows and a tall 
spire was erected on the front” (Lynch, 1973). The architecture of this
particular building reminds me of the churches designed by Architect Benjamin 
D. Price. Price’s plans were sold by the Methodist Episcopal Church Board to 
its congregations to discourage them from building churches of their own design.

The original church building was moved to the back of the property, 
facing Seventh Street and close to the train depot. As per Muno (1975), 
“the original church building on the back of the lot was leased to 
A.W. Schwan in 1891 and permission was given to repair and remodel the 
structure for business purposes by removing the belfry, erecting a square 
front and making the room suitable for display of goods”. Schwan set up a 
tinning and plumbing shop in the old building and frequently advertised in 
local newspapers.

The old building even showed up in the Sanborn fire insurance map from 1892. 
However, the old parsonage was missing from the map. No one is 
sure as to what happened to the old parsonage. The apple tree was still 
around in 1896 (Hines, 1896) and was probably cut down in 1900 when new buildings
were built beside the church. The Oregon City Enterprise (June 20, 1902) made a 
reference to the tree while reporting on pioneers reunion - “In a lot adjoining 
the Methodist church in Oregon City there stood until a few years ago, when it 
was cut down and sold for souvenirs, an old apple tree, the first tree of its 
kind in Oregon, now so famous for its apples.”

The old church building showed up again in the fire insurance map from 1900 
but was no longer present in the 1911 map. The building was probably relocated 
somewhere between 1903 and 1909 when the M. E. Church went through a few major 
renovations including hoisting the church to make it a second story, and 
adding the L. Adams Department store at the street level (Oregon City Enterprise, June 
26, 1903). 

![M. E. Church in 1914](/images/no-ordinary-tree/1914-main-st-7th-oregon-city.jpg?style=centerme)

The last time there was any reference to the old church building was when the 
1909 Methodist Conference, held at Cottage Grove, discussed moving the 
old historical church building to the campus of Willamette University 
(Oregon City Enterprise, September 24, 1909). Unfortunately, the present day 
Oregon City United Methodist Church has no record of when the original building 
was torn down. Most of the church documents were destroyed in the big fire 
of November 15, 1919. The fire completely burnt down the church including 
the Price Bros. department store on the first floor (The Sunday Oregonian, 
November 16, 1919). I heard the corner post of the old church building was 
saved as a memorial and currently displayed at the Museum of the 
Oregon Territory, Oregon City.

The apple tree was cut down and sold as keepsakes. Some wooden pieces were 
turned into plaques and others into gavels.  A few of the historic artifacts are 
in display at the Methodist United Church. Two of the gavels, displayed at the church,
 were used at the Willamette Mission School near Salem.

One such gavel was presented to Abernethy Grange (Oregon City) by Captain 
John T. Apperson of [Unio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unio_(sternwheeler)) 
fame. It was fashioned from the apple tree and the handle carved from another 
historic tree, this time a cherry, planted by [Seth Luelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Lewelling)
(Oregon City Enterprise, November 18, 1904). Luelling, a horticulturist, known 
for creating the Bing cherry. This particular gavel had an engraved silver 
band around it. I was given the impression that the gavel is still in use by the 
grange. As to what happened to the old church building, and the parsonage is 
still a mystery.

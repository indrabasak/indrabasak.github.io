You always wonder what was the spark that inspired Sarat Chandra to write 
_Charitraheen_, Tagore to compose _Gitanjali_, and Einstein to come up with the 
theory of relativity. I never looked it up. Newton first thought about 
gravity after he observed an apple falling from a tree. As for Satyajit Ray, 
it was the opportunity to illustrate a children’s novel, 
_Aam Antir Bhepu_ (Mango Seed Whistle), which ultimately led him to direct 
his magnum opus - _Panther Panchali_ (Song of the Road), the first movie of 
his Apu trilogy.

In 1944 (or 1945), Ray received an offer from D. K. Gupta, the owner of Signet 
Press, to illustrate _Aam Antir Bhepu_ - an abridged version of the Bengali novel 
_Panther Panchali_ by Bibhuti Bhushan Bandyopadhyay. At that time Ray was still 
working for D. J. Kaymer, the British advertising agency, while also 
freelancing on the side for Signet Press designing book covers. D. K. Gupta, 
who went by DK, started the small publishing house while he was one of the 
heads at Kaymer. Ray owed a great deal to DK, for not only giving him his 
first job but also for suggesting that the shortened version would make 
a great movie.

DK was surprised that Ray hadn’t read Panther Panchali when he made his 
initial proposal for illustrating _Aam Antir Bhepu_. Ray laid the blame on not reading the book 
to his preoccupation with music and films. He ended up drawing twenty-one 
wood-cut illustrations, including the front cover, for _Aam Antir Bhepu_. They 
captured the small pleasures of a young boy, Apu, and his family who were having
a tough time making ends meet.

My first glance at Ray’s drawings reminded me of the linocut paintings of Nandalal 
Bose in part one of Tagore’s _Sahaj Path_ - a Bengali primer for 
every child of my generation and earlier. Probably, 
it’s no longer the case today. It’s not surprising Ray was influenced by 
Bose who was one of his mentors at Santiniketan. The illustrations follow the 
old Bengal tradition of Kalighat Pat.

_Panther Panchali_ again came back to Ray’s life when he was asked to draw Bibhuti Bhushan 
Bandyopadhyay as part of an advertising campaign for an ink manufacturer. 
It was probably during this time that he got  acquainted with
Bibhuti Bhushan’s family which will later prove to be crucial in getting 
the film rights for _Panther Panchali_. Mrs. Rama Bandyopadhyay, 
Bibhuti Bhushan’s widow, remained a steadfast supporter of Ray even 
when another producer, who Ray approached earlier for financing, tried to 
snag the film rights under him.

It was the spring of 1950 when the idea of turning the story into a movie started
taking serious roots. Rays started writing down his initials thoughts of the film 
aboard a liner named _Maloja_ during his long voyage to London on an assignment 
for Kaymer. The treatment of _Pather Panchali_ was completed during his trip back 
home after a five months stays in London. Though few of the final wash-sketches 
of the movie actually line up with his original illustrations, you still 
get the feeling it all started with the lonely mango seed.

After going through his illustrations and wash sketches for _Panther Panchali_, 
I get the impression that the movie was just a live re-enactment of his 
drawings where nature was brought to life. The dialogs and the screenplay 
were just an afterthought - the magic of the movie was in its composition, 
photography, editing, and Ravi Shankar’s evocative music.

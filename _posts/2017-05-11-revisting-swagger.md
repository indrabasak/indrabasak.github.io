Lately, I am getting a few `how to do` comments on my last Swagger posting. Most of them involve either renaming a REST controller or sorting. Also, ran into a few interesting Swagger challenges at my work. Now that it has been over a year since I my lasting postings on Swagger, it is a good time to revisit the subject.

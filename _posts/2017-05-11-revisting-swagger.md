Lately, I am getting a few `how to do` comments on my last Swagger posting. Most of them are similar in nature. Also ran into a few interesting Swagger challenges at my work. Now that it has been over a year since I wrote a couple of blogs on Swagger, I thought it might be an opportune time to revisit the subject.

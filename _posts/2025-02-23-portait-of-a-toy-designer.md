When you come across a toy, have you ever wondered about the mind behind its creation, the person who 
conceptualized and designed it? Such thoughts never crossed my mind until I encountered the Domino Blocks 
from the 1950s, manufactured by A. C. Gilbert. On the back of the wooden box, an uncommon sight caught 
my eye: it read, "Domino Blocks by Anne Farrell."

It's remarkably rare for a toy designer's name to be prominently featured on their creation, and even more 
so when it’s an A. C. Gilbert toy, considering that A. C. Gilbert himself is renowned for inventing the iconic 
Erector Sets. The label sparked an interest in me, drawing me into the world of Anne Farrell, a visionary 
who left her mark on the world of toys.

My quest to uncover the story of Anne Farrell began with a quick online search, though information was sparse. 
I stumbled upon her obituary on a grave site, which provided a short glimpse into her life. Born on 
November 23, 1910, in Mount Bliss, Michigan, Anne Farrell was the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Henry John Farrell.

Her journey into toy design began at Marygrove College in Detroit. It was there that she first encountered the 
frustrations of her nursery teacher friend, who complained about the lack of durable, functional toys for 
children. Most of the available toys were fragile and often made from harmful materials, sparking in 
Anne a desire to create something better.

Driven by a newfound interest, Anne Farrell decided to embark on an educational journey to master the art 
of toy design. She enrolled in Columbia University, taking courses in design, child psychology, 
and merchandising. Upon her graduation, she landed a position at Saks Fifth Avenue in their toy department. 
There, Anne had the opportunity to put her knowledge into practice, contributing to the design of a line of sand 
cars manufactured and sold exclusively by Saks.

Anne made various attempts to present her designs to various toy manufacturers. While many companies appreciated 
her innovative ideas, they were reluctant to take the risk, as her designs were a significant departure from the 
conventional toys of that era. 

During this period, Anne Farrell's journey took an unexpected turn when she 
encountered Alva Myrdal, a future Nobel Peace laureate from Sweden, and Einer Kumm. They recognized her potential 
and sponsored her trip to Sweden, giving Anne an opportunity to work at Akuma toy factory in Tyringe. Anne worked 
closely with skilled woodworkers, learning and creating new toy designs. This experience helped her ideas 
take shape and grow. Anne's days in Sweden drew to a close as the ominous clouds of World War II began to 
gather over Europe. It was on September 1, 1939, the very day Anne's toys were set to be sold to the public in 
the Swedish market, that Hitler launched his invasion of Poland.

When Anne returned to the United States, toy makers and buyers became more interested in American-made toys. 
As the war loomed, people in America started to avoid toys made in Germany, Italy, and Japan. In 1940, 
Anne filed several patents for her wooden toys. It is said that two large toy companies manufactured her 
toys, but she did her own marketing from her base in New York City. She also began designing toys for 
Milton Bradley around this time. She split her time between overseeing toy production at Springfield and creating new, 
high-quality wooden toys in New York. A unique thing about the toys made by Milton Bradley was that each one had 
her name on it. In 1942, she married John Daniel Ford, a U.S. Army Captain during World War II.

By late 1940s, Anne was hired by A. C. Gilbert to design simple wooden toys for 
"children of the pre-screwdriver stage". Anne's imagination had no limits, and she came up with many toys for 
young children. One of her creations was a simple six-inch cube. This toy was designed to be held with both hands, 
encouraging kids to use both hands equally while also helping with their overall development. During this period, 
Anne also created other building toys, including the delightful Domino Blocks, each of them carrying her 
signature on the box.

I’m not sure why Anne’s toys are hard to find except for the Domino Blocks. The only other toys I have come 
across are the building blocks and five pigs from one of her patents. I've seen pictures in publications of 
wooden trains, automobiles, and rocking horses she designed. Anne made sturdy wooden toys with rounded corners, 
built to last for generations. They remind me of the wooden toy tradition from Scandinavian countries.

By the late 1950s, it seemed as though Anne had quietly stepped away from the world of toy design, her name
fading from the pages of the industry's history. My search yielded no signs of her work beyond that period. 
Anne Farrell's journey, remarkable and influential, ultimately concluded on October 9, 1998, in the town of 
Charlevoix, Michigan, leaving behind a legacy of enduring wooden toys cherished by generations.

It always amuses me when someone mentions that a particular brick or brand is a clone of LEGO. People either 
misinformed or tend to forget that LEGO itself was the original clone. The other day, when I brought up this point 
with someone, his retort was that it didn't matter; LEGO was the one that thrived and transformed their bricks into a 
billion-dollar enterprise. While it is true that LEGO has thrived and become synonymous with toy building bricks, 
it should not be forgotten that LEGO itself originated as a clone of Kiddicraft.

LEGO, despite being a clone itself, hasn't hesitated to take legal action against other companies producing similar 
interlocking bricks. The article ["Lego vs. Tyco: The Battle of the Bricks”](https://www.retroist.com/p/lego-vs-tyco-the-battle-of-the-bricks) 
details the legal conflict between LEGO and Tyco. In 1984, LEGO brought a case Tyco, the maker of "Super Blocks," 
in 1984 for copyright infringements. Although Tyco was headquartered in New Jersey, USA, the case against them was 
initiated in Hong Kong, the location where Tyco produced their brick molds. Although Tyco lost the case and only 
had to pay legal fees. 

Here's an interesting snippet at the beginning of the judgement by Lord Oliver in [Interlego A.G v Tyco Industries Inc & Ors](https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1988/3.html),
which provides a brief history of LEGO's origins:

> "The system was originally designed by a Mr. Hilary Page who marketed it under the trade-name "Kiddicraft". It was 
> the subject-matter of U.K. patents which expired in 1954 and 1959 respectively. The appellant is a Swiss company 
> holding the intellectual property rights of the group which was originally founded by a Mr. Christiansen and 
> has its headquarters in Denmark. It will be convenient to refer to the appellant and the group to which it 
> belongs as "Lego". 
> 
> The Kiddicraft design was not protected by patent in Denmark and it is not in dispute that 
> the original Lego bricks were, for practical purposes, a precise copy of the Hilary Page design. No point arises 
> on this. Prior to these proceedings Lego purchased from Mr, Page's executors any copyright still subsisting in the Page
> designs."
> 
> Interlego A.G v. Tyco Industries Inc & Ors (Hong Kong) [1988] UKPC 3 (05 May 1988)

Another startling observation from the Privy Council's judgment was the acknowledgment by Godtfred Christiansen,
President of LEGO, and Berhnard Bodnia, the brick mold maker, of their deliberate choice to replicate the Kiddicraft
brick design, albeit with modifications to make it resemble a Danish brick.

> "The original decision made by the Christiansens was to make the bricks in the same way as the Kiddicraft brick, 
> but to be designed to look like a Danish brick. Some changes became necessary in order to achieve the effect 
> that was required, which included the introduction of sharp edges and flat knobs, and an alteration in the 
> measurements from inches into millimetres to conform to the metric system that was used on the continent."
> 
> This was based on the evidence of Mr. Godtfred Christiansen, the President of the appellant company, and 
> on that of Mr. Berhnard Bodnia, who was responsible for making the moulds.

Adrian Lithgow of The Mail noted that Mrs. Oreline Page, the widow of Kiddicraft's inventor, Hilary Page, reminisced 
about how her husband conceived the idea for the bricks shortly after the onset of World War II. Intrigued by children's play, 
he designed bricks that were subtly different from those of LEGO. Although he never fully pursued the concept, 
the Christiansens in Denmark recognized its potential and implemented key adaptations. Tragically, 
Mr. Hilary Page passed away in 1957, unaware of LEGO's eventual triumph. In 1981, LEGO reached an out-of-court settlement 
of £45,000 with the new owners of Kiddicraft to resolve any remaining rights. [ The Mail, 1981](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/101087/lego-kiddicraft-settle/)

Tyco counter-sued LEGO in the U.S. court system to uphold their manufacturing rights. Tyco's legal complaint sought 
judgment to affirm that its value comparisons did not infringe on Lego's rights, while Lego counterclaimed to 
halt Tyco's advertisements, which they argued were misleading. The disputed claims included assertions that 
Tyco bricks were indistinguishable from Lego, offered better value, and connected across different product lines. 
Neither party sought damages in this litigation. This legal battle concluded in 1987, allowing Tyco to continue 
making "Lego look-a-likes without changing a plastic molecule. However, U.S. Federal Judge Garrett E. Brown Jr. 
in the U.S. District Court in New Jersey ordered Tyco to stop advertising its "Super Blocks" as just like Lego's, 
only cheaper."

My journey with Hilary Page began in the early 2000s, a time when I stumbled upon the lesser-known origins of LEGO and 
discovered its roots in Kiddicraft's Self-Locking Bricks. Back in 1947, Hilary Page patented and released the 
first Kiddicraft Self-Locking Building Brick sets, while LEGO's Automatic Binding Bricks made their debut two 
years later, in 1949. Information about this creator of innovative toy inventor was scarce, both in print 
and online. It seemed to me that Hilary Page was unjustly forgotten by history.

With this in mind, I began to collect Kiddicraft brick sets, gradually expanding my collection to include other 
Kiddicraft toys and even a book. I harbored the hope that one day I would share Hilary Page's extraordinary 
story with the world. However, by late 2006, it felt as though my efforts were in vain. Chas Saunter had 
already established an excellent [website dedicated to Hilary Page and his creations](https://www.hilarypagetoys.com/), 
effectively retelling his story.

The Brickfetish site does an excellent job of recounting the history of Kiddicraft and Hilary Page. 
Rather than regurgitating the well-known facts about the inventor, I aim to shed light on lesser-known aspects. 
Hilary Page was not just a toy inventor; he was also a child psychologist deeply invested in revolutionizing 
the design of children's toys. He even advised parents against purchasing mechanical toys for children 
under five and encouraged buying small dolls for little girls.

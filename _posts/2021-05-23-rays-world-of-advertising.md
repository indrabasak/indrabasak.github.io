Growing up in Calcutta, Satyajit Ray, the famous Indian movie director,
had a silent presence in my life through his many movies and short
stories. [Feluda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feluda), one of his immortal 
creations, captured my childhood imagination
along with the Belgian teenager, [Tintin](https://www.tintin.com/en).
Ray's sketches almost always accompanied his stories. Come to think
of it, his sketches were the first thing that attracted me to his writings.
His drawings always seemed to capture the essence of the story plot.
I wasn't really surprised to learn that his career as an illustrator began much before
his start in movies and writings. He mastered his craft as an illustrator and
story teller from his stints at advertising houses.

In April 1943, Ray got his break as a visual artist with the British advertising firm,
D. J. Keymer (the present-day Ogilvy and Mather) with a starting salary of
80 (65 + 15) Indian rupees per month (approximately US $26 in early 40's exchange rate).
He landed this job after sitting idle for nearly six months since his sudden 
departure from [Santiniketan](https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5495/). 
Ray went to Santiniketan to study art and calligraphy after completing his 
undergraduate studies from the [Presidency College](https://www.presiuniv.ac.in/). He trained
under the tutelage of [Nandalal Bose](https://www.wikiart.org/en/nandalal-bose),
one of the pioneers of the Bengal School of Art. Initially, I wasn't sure
why he left Santiniketan before completing his training except I read somewhere
that he wanted to support his mother financially. Later upon reading his memoir,
_My Years with Apu_, I came to realize that he had no intention of becoming
a painter but rather wanted to pursue his interest in being a commercial artist.

Ray's time at Keymer was a productive one. He was behind some of the
most interesting advertising campaigns from that time. One of his more famous ad
campaigns was for Paludrine, an anti-malarial drug, made by
Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI). I was only aware of ICI as a paint and
chemical company with its Indian head office in Chowringhee. I didn't have a
clue about its pharmaceutical division. Interestingly, the pharmaceutical
division was spun off as a new company in the early 90s and the spinoff nowadays
goes by the name [AstraZeneca](https://www.astrazeneca.com/) - the maker of a 
COVID-19 vaccine.

Getting back to the Paludrine campaign, I've come across three different ads from
this series. What stayed with me most about these Sunday newspaper ads
 were the dramatic nature of Ray's compositions. They had a narrative prose
 to them that was more common in his movies. All ads from this campaign
 depicted daily lives of households on a Sunday morning - family members
 interacting with each other in a common living space while taking Paludrine.
 One showed a modern Indian family with a retinue of helpers; the other a
 more traditional middle class family; and the third a family
 in a garden setting. If you look closely, you can't miss Ray's signature at
 the bottom left hand corner of the first ad.

One can notice the influence of Ray's days at Santiniketan in the
brush drawings of Jabakusum hair oil ads. The ads made fun of
modern women's hesitancy to comb hair or take showers in order to prevent hair loss. Similar to
Ray's sketches in his short stories, one gets the underlying message of these ads
without even reading the accompanied text. Jabakusum brings back memories of
my grandfather using the red scented oil. It came in a red and white packaging
with old style illustrations of women putting oil on their hair.

The ad campaign for the Indian Tea Board was more infographic in nature -
telling us the five rules for making good tea. Though Ray took part in various
other ad campaigns from his time at Keymer, it's difficult to pinpoint his exact
contribution for every single ad since they were the fruition of a collective
effort of different members of a team.
